# Java Expert System Shell RECOMENDER SYSTEM
## Programming Languages Recomender System
This recomender system is written in Java Expert System Shell (JESS).
This was a university mini project, I created a rule engine using JESS to recomend the best programming language the user choose pick
as a starting language.
The rule engine interacts with the user through targeted questions to collect facts about the user, so we can recomend a programming language.
